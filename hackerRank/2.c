/*Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum
Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.
Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your 4 variables.
Use the + and - operator to perform the following operations:
Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.
